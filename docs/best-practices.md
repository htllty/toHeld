## Repository Structure

### Essential Files

Every good repository should include:

- **README.md** - Clear project description, installation, and usage instructions
- **LICENSE** - Legal terms for using the project
- **.gitignore** - Files and directories to exclude from version control
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Guidelines for contributors

### Documentation

- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples and code snippets
- Organize documentation in a logical structure

### Code Organization

- Use meaningful file and directory names
- Group related functionality together
- Include examples and sample code
- Follow consistent naming conventions

## Version Control Best Practices

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Include more details in the body if necessary

### Branching

- Use descriptive branch names

3. Usage examples
4. Contributing guidelines
5. License information

### Code Comments

- Provide clear reproduction steps for bugs
- Include relevant context and examples
- Be responsive to feedback

### Code Reviews

- Be constructive and respectful
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain your suggestions clearly
- Acknowledge good practices

- Use .gitignore to exclude configuration files with secrets
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Follow the principle of least privilege
